File and folder contents I used and need to remember:

TitanicDisaster:
  1.	Dropping non-numeric columns
  2.	Mapping nominal non-numeric data with numeric value
  3.	Missing value count of every column
  4.	Filling missing values(mean, frequent)
  5.	Frequency count of column values
  6.	Separating features and target
  7.	Train test splitting
  8.	Applying Support Vector Machine algorithm
  9.	Evaluation(accuracy, precision, recall)

RosenblattPerceptron.cpp:
  1.	Perceptron class with constructor
  2.	Private fields: weights, bias, learning rate
  3.	Public methods: update,  training, test 
  4.	Solve AND, OR problem

BackPropagationLab.cpp:
  1.	Node(perceptron) class with constructor
      •	Fields: weights, bias 
      •	Methods: net calculate, activation(sigmoid)
  2.	BackPropagation class, constructor creates necessary perceptron for the network
      •	Methods:
        Training: creates network using previously created perceptrons, find errors and updates
        Update: Updates every nodes weights and bias
        Test: find output of the network y from given input x1 and x2
